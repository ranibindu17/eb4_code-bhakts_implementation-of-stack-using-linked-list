### 1. Focus Area : 

Reinforce theoretical concepts (re-registering concepts learned previously).
In this lab, user are going to be ready to understand a way to run algorithm of Linked List and also visualize stack implementation element by element during this simulator.

### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

### 3. Instructional Strategy

#### Name of Instructional Strategy : <u> Expository

#### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Implementing Stack using Linked List means to make a Linked List that behave like a Stack because both are  logical entities. For any data structure to act as a Stack, it should have push() method to add data on top and pop() method to remove data from top.After performing the experiment, user shall give answer to the questions asked.

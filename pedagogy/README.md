#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 When we say "implementing Stack using Linked List", we mean how we can make a Linked List behave like a Stack, after all they are all logical entities. So for any data structure to act as a Stack, it should have push() method to add data on top and pop() method to remove data from top. Which is exactly what we did and hence accomplished to make a Linked List behave as a Stack. After performing the experiment, student shall give answer to the questions asked.

<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:--
1.| Students will be able to describe basics of stack and linked list | On the simulator screen, student selects proper lens and other objects in the set up to drag and drop at proper place as per the experimental setup. | Q Drag and drop correct apparatus and labels to various components of experimental setup. <br>Q. Which one of the following lens is used for interference to occur in Newton’s ring experiment?<br>A. Convex Lens <br>B. Plano Convex Lens <br>C. BiConcave Lens <br>D. Plano Concave Lens
2.| Students will be able to Use basics of stack data structure and linked lists | On simulator screen, student observe the experimental set up and attempt the question | What is the condition for constructive interference pattern?<br>A. integral multiple of wavelength<br>B. half multiples of wavelength
3.| Students will be able to Describe various operations on stack data structure | On simulator screen, student set the medium of interference as air from select medium option seen and answer the true or false question  | Q  The necessary condition for interference is<br> A. The sources of the waves must be coherent, constant phase difference. <br> B. The waves should be monochromatic, single wavelength <br> C. A and B both <br>D. none of A and B
4.| Students will be able to Describe various operations on linked lists | Set the position of the plane glass plate at 45 <sup>o</sup>. Switch on the monochromatic source. Set travelling microscope at proper resolution position, so that the rings are visible. Control the position of the movement screw of the travelling microscope so as to set it at tangential position of the ring and the ring diameter should be noted down. | Q. What is the role of glass plate set at 45<sup>o</sup>?<br>A. To pass the light<br>B. To deflect the light downward direction <br>C. To increase the illumination <br>D. To diffract the light <br>Q. What is the least count of the travelling microscope?<br>Answer: 0.01 mm
5.| Students will be able to Implementing stack using linked list | On the simulator screen, student change the position of the cross wire from one side of the image to other side of image by pressing the “Traverse” button. Student set the cross wire is at tangential position. Add the ring diameter in the observation table. | Q.Fill in the blank with proper option Newton’s rings are ______ and as moved away from the centre, the rings appear ________ and _________. <br>Answer: Concentric, thinner, closer

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the experiment screen | To open screen to perform experiment 
2.| Student will drag and drop various apparatus parts at appropriate positions on the blank canvas.  | Simulator will display a blank canvas appears on the screen and all apparatus parts separately and provide option to drag and drop the parts at appropriate position. <br>If student located it wrongly appropriate message will be displayed. | To recall the set-up
3.| Student will confirm the labeling of the experimental set-up appearing on the simulator  | Simulator will display labeled image with rays of light complete ray movement   | To provide basic environment to start the experiment.
4.| Student calculate least count and enters the value of least count in the field provided  | Simulator will display main scale and verniers scale with enlarge view Simulator accepts the input of least count value and if the student is correct display massage “correct least count” or else gives the hint to get correct value  | To let the student understand concept of least count.
5.| Student will move the screw of the travelling microscope and set the cross wire at tangential position. Note readings for various rings. | Simulator will allow the student to change the position of the cross wire from one side of the image to other side of image when the student press the “Traverse” button. Put the cross wire is at tangential position.  | To arrange the experimental condition
6.| Student will click on the “Add to Readings” button to store the ring diameter value in the observation table  | Simulator will display the “Add to Readings” Button and store the ring diameter value in the observation table. | To record and store readings
7.| Student will click on the “Display Table”  button to see the observation table. <br>Student will click on the “Reset”  button | Simulator will display the observation table and plot the graph with given set of readings. Simulator will reset the conditions to original  | To observe the recorded readings and plot the graph.<br>To reset the situation with the initial conditions.  
8.| Student will calculate the value and enter the answer in input text box and click the submit button, with the help of formula for wavelength and refractive index | Simulator will display input text box and button “submit”, where student will enter calculated wavelength and refractive index. If answer is correct: Display the success message and record the result. If answer is wrong : provide clue and Display input text box and button “submit” again | To make the student calculate the wavelength of light To check for the calculated value whether it is correct or not.
9.| Student  changes the medium from the list of mediums and observes the rings pattern  | Simulator display the corresponding image for the selected medium and display the question <br>Q.| The reason of change in image is,  <br>a. instrument resolution power <br>b. change in the medium | To accept the input from student and provide feedback to student that the images shrink when there is a medium other than air present.

### 3. Instructional Strategy

#### Name of Instructional Strategy : <u> Expository

#### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
When we say "implementing Stack using Linked List", we mean how we can make a Linked List behave like a Stack, after all they are all logical entities. So for any data structure to act as a Stack, it should have push() method to add data on top and pop() method to remove data from top. Which is exactly what we did and hence accomplished to make a Linked List behave as a Stack. After performing the experiment, student shall give answer to the questions asked.

| :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------: |
| 1.    | Student will click on Simulation tab                                                             | Simulator opens the experiment screen                                                                      |         To open screen to perform experiment          |
| 2.    | Student will watch the example simulation so that they get an idea of how the linked list works. | Simulator will display the animation of push and pop in a stack using linked list with the algorithm also. |                 To recall the set-up                  | To let the student understand concept of push and pop in stack. |
| 3.    | Student will now enter the numeric value they want to insert in the stack.                       | Simulator will accept the value if it is positive and then wait for the user to select from next button.   | To provide basic environment to start the experiment. | To make the students understand that only positive value can be inserted in the stack. |
| 4.    | Student will then push the number in the stack as it is empty.                                   | Simulator will show the animation as well as push the element in the stack .                               |  To let the student understand the working of push.   |
| 5.    | Student will then enter another input to push or pop in the stack                                | Simulator will pop the element from the top.                                                               |   To let the student understand the working of pop.   |
| 6.    | Student will click on the “Clear Stack” button to delete the whole stack and start a new one.    | Simulator will remove all the numbers and display an empty stack.                                          |               To start an empty stack.                |

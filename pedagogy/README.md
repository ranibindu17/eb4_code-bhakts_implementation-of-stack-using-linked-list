### 3. Instructional Strategy

#### Name of Instructional Strategy : <u> Expository

#### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
When we say "implementing Stack using Linked List", we mean how we can make a Linked List behave like a Stack, after all they are all logical entities. So for any data structure to act as a Stack, it should have push() method to add data on top and pop() method to remove data from top. Which is exactly what we did and hence accomplished to make a Linked List behave as a Stack. After performing the experiment, user shall give answer to the questions asked.

### 5. Simulator Interactions:

<br>
| Sr.No | What Simulator will do? | What Students will do ?| Purpose of the task|
| :---- | :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------: | 
| 1.    | Simulator screen will start and show two tabs:<br>Learn by example and perform the experiment. | Student will able to select the tab |       To display the animation of push and pop in a stack using linked list with the algorithm or to perform the experiment. |
| 2.    |Simulator show the various operations of stack by example by selecting the learn by example tab. | Student will be able to understand the concept of various operations of stack.  |   To display the various operation of stack.   | 
| 3.    |On Experiment tab, three  tab are displayed as PUSH,POP and CLEAR| Student will select PUSH tab and enter the number.   |To start simulation and to visualize the element by element building the stack |
| 4.    | Simulator will then push the number in the stack as it is empty.                                   | Simulator will show the animation as well as push the element in the stack .                               |    To let the user understand the working of push.    |
| 5.    | Simulator will then enter another input to push or pop in the stack                                | Simulator will pop the element from the top.                                                               |    To let the user understand the working of pop.     |
| 6.    | User will click on the “Clear Stack” button to delete the whole stack and start a new one.    | Simulator will remove all the numbers and display an empty stack.                                          |               To start an empty stack.                |

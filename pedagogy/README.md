### 3. Instructional Strategy

#### Name of Instructional Strategy : <u> Expository

#### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
When we say "implementing Stack using Linked List", we mean how we can make a Linked List behave like a Stack, after all they are all logical entities. So for any data structure to act as a Stack, it should have push() method to add data on top and pop() method to remove data from top. Which is exactly what we did and hence accomplished to make a Linked List behave as a Stack. After performing the experiment, user shall give answer to the questions asked.

b) O(n)<br>
c) O(logn)<br>
d) Either O(1) or O(n)<br>

3)  Which of these is not an application of linked list?<br>
a) To implement file systems<br>
<b>b) For separate chaining in hash-tables<br></b>
c) To implement non-binary trees<br>
d) Random Access of elements<br>

4) Which of the following points is/are true about Linked List data structure when it is compared with array. <br>
<b>a) Arrays have better cache locality that can make them better in terms of performance.<br></b>
b) It is easy to insert and delete elements in Linked List.<br>
c)Random access is not allowed in a typical implementation of Linked Lists.<br>

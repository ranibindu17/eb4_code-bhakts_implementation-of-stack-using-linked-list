<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>
In this lab the course is designed to develop skills to design and analyze simple linear and non linear data structures. It strengthen the ability to the students to identify and apply the suitable data structure for the given real world problem. It enables them to gain knowledge in practical applications of data structures .


<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

- Stack is a linear data structure in which we restrict the operations over it in a particular order.

- The order in which insertions and deletions are allowed is called LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out) i.e. the element that is inserted in the last is the first to come out or the element that is inserted first is the last to come out.

There are two ways of implementing stacks, Using Arrays or Using Linked Lists

- Stacks can be easily implemented using a linked list. Stack is a data structure to which a data can be added using the push() method and data can be removed from it using the pop() method. With Linked list, the push operation can be replaced by the addAtFront() method of linked list and pop operation can be replaced by a function which deletes the front node of the linked list.

The major operations we perform on stack are :
- Push() - Inserts an element to the top of the stack. It generates a Stack overflow error if there is no memory space available for inserting the element.
- Pop() - Removes an element from the top of the stack. It generates a Stack underflow error if there are no elements in the stack to be removed.
- Peek() - Gives the element on the top of the stack without modifying the contents of the stack.
- isEmpty() - Returns true if the stack is empty , else returns false

When we say "implementing Stack using Linked List", we mean how we can make a Linked List behave like a Stack, after all they are all logical entities. So for any data structure to act as a Stack, it should have push() method to add data on top and pop() method to remove data from top. Which is exactly what we did and hence accomplished to make a Linked List behave as a Stack.

In this way our Linked list will virtually become a Stack with push() and pop() methods.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

B.Tech CSE /IT , MCA students

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

The course is aligned to give students, an understanding by visualizing of how stack is implemented using linked list.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>
In this lab the course is designed to develop skills to design and analyze simple linear and non linear data structures. It strengthen the ability to the students to identify and apply the suitable data structure for the given real world problem. It enables them to gain knowledge in practical applications of data structures .


<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
There are two ways of implementing stacks, Using Arrays or Using Linked Lists

- In this experiment students will look at the fundamentals of stack , including performance specifications. Then they are introduced to the concept of linked structures and focus on their utility in developing simple, safe, clear, and efficient implementations of stacks .

- When we say "implementing Stack using Linked List", we mean how we can make a Linked List behave like a Stack, after all they are all logical entities. So for any data structure to act as a Stack, it should have push() method to add data on top and pop() method to remove data from top. Which is exactly what we did and hence accomplished to make a Linked List behave as a Stack.

In this way our Linked list will virtually become a Stack with push() and pop() methods.


<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

B.Tech CSE /IT , MCA students

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

- In this experiment students will look at the fundamentals of stack , including performance specifications. Then introduction to the concept of linked structures and focus on their utility in developing simple, safe, clear, and efficient implementations of stacks .
- The course is aligned to give students, an understanding by visualizing of how stack is implemented using linked list.
